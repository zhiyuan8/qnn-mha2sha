# LLaMA3.2 GQA Tutorial
This folder / package includes Jupyter Notebooks, code, documentation and assets to optimize, prepare, convert and execute the LLaMA3.2 machine learning (ML) models on Snapdragon-based Windows devices.

Please follow the README instructions in each of the following notebook folders *in sequence*:
- [Step-1 folder](step1) consists of notebooks for LLaMa based model adaption and quantization using AIMET
- [Step-2 folder](step2) consists of notebooks for producing Qualcomm AI Runtime executable context from artifacts produced by notebooks in step 1 
- [Step-3 folder](step3) consists of notebooks for running model inference on target using the artifacts generated from notebooks in steps 1 and 2
